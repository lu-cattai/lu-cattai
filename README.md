# Hi there, I'm [Seu Nome Atual] 👋

**Software Engineer | AI Researcher | Master's Candidate at UNESP**

I am a Computer Scientist focused on the intersection of **High-Performance Computing** and **Generative AI**. Currently, my work centers on the optimization of **Large Language Model (LLM) inference**, specifically regarding memory management and efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Expertise

- **Languages:** Python (Advanced), JavaScript/TypeScript (ES6+), C++ (Performance-focused).
- **AI & Data:** LLMs (Llama, OpenAI API), LangChain, RAG Pipelines, NLP, and Inference Optimization.
- **Frontend:** React.js, Styled Components, Redux, and modern Web APIs.
- **Infrastructure:** Linux, Git, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments.

### 🔬 Research & Projects

- **Master’s Thesis (In Progress):** Optimizing LLM inference through advanced memory management strategies to enable high-quality AI in limited-resource hardware.
- **Scientific Publication:** *Analysis of the Effectiveness of Language Models in Code Optimization* (ERAD-SP 2024). 
- **Full-stack Development:** Built a comprehensive web platform for scientific information democratization using **React.js** and **Node.js**.

> **Note:** Most of my recent technical work is hosted in private repositories due to academic research agreements and ongoing R&D projects.
